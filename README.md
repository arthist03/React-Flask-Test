## 🚀 Launch Sequence (Installation)

### 🛠️ Prerequisites (The Essentials)

Before we embark on this epic journey, make sure you have:

- 🐍 **Python 3.7+** - The snake that powers our backend
- 🟢 **Node.js 16+** - The engine of our frontend dreams
- 📦 **npm** - The package manager that makes magic happen

### 🎬 Act 1: Backend Setup (The Python Show)

```bash
# Enter the Python kingdom
cd backend

# Summon the required powers
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Awaken the Flask dragon! 🐉
python app.py
```

🎉 **Ta-da!** Your Flask server is now purring at `http://localhost:5000`

### 🎭 Act 2: Frontend Setup (The React Spectacular)

```bash
# Return to the main stage
cd ..

# Gather all the React warriors
npm install

# Launch the Vite rocket! 🚀
npm run dev
```

🌟 **Boom!** Your React app is now dancing at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎪 The Grand Performance

1. 🎬 **Start both servers** (Flask & Vite) - It's showtime!
2. 🌐 **Visit** `http://localhost:3000` - Enter the theater
3. 🎊 **Marvel** at the "Flask backend is running!" message - Success!
4. ✍️ **Add tasks** like "Learn to juggle code" - Be creative!
5. 👀 **Watch** them appear in real-time - Pure magic!

## 🛣️ API Routes (The Treasure Map)

Our Flask backend serves these delicious endpoints:

| Route | Method | Purpose | Response |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| `/api/health` | GET | 💊 Health check | `{"status": "healthy"}` |
| `/api/tasks` | GET | 📋 Fetch all tasks | `{"tasks": [...]}` |
| `/api/tasks` | POST | ➕ Add new task | `{"task": {...}}` |
